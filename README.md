Presentation delivered at Code4Lib Southeast 2017, Atlanta GA by Kevin Beswick

## Abstract

Last year, NCSU Libraries released QuickSearch, an open source, Ruby on Rails based toolkit for easily creating bento-box search applications. Since then, we've added new features, improved existing features, released new searcher plugins, and improved documentation. This talk will outline several improvements we've made, such as making it easier to create plugins to integrate with external APIs, improved analytics collection and visualization, typeahead support, as well as features we have planned, and our vision for the future of bento-box search. I'll also outline a recently completed project that migrated an existing bento-box search application for Special Collections to the QuickSearch toolkit.
